# Algorytmy macierzowe | Matrix algorithms
It is a course at AGH UST, each set of tasks is in different direcory.
Przemek Rola ([@kujonick](https://github.com/Kujonick)) has wrote flops counter, [class Number](https://github.com/puszekjuliuszek/macierzowe/blob/main/zestaw1/Number.py)
and this is a good code.
## Usage
You can just clone this repo and run the notebooks and they will collect data and plot them. For the reason that data collection takes timeee I recommend saving dataframes to cv files just as we did

MIT, feel free to use our code, but it would be nice if you could **leave a star** in that case
